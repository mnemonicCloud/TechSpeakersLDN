# TechSpeakersLDN

Welcome! You arrived at the Tech Speakers London Project.

You may aspire to become a speaker, you may want to improve you presentation skills or you already are experienced and in demand. If you are a teacher, a lecturer or even facilitate workshops you also are most invited. Or you simply just like listen to good talks or organise conferences or meetups and wished that speakers could have been better trained in particular areas. It is the aim of this Tech Speakers project to enable tech community to teach and inspire.

Our main goal is to create a strong community-driven technical speaker development program, 
with a global posse of talented tech speakers working together 
to advance the open web, with help from Mozilla.
